*Descriptions *
---
* Inside of the data folder you can see the full XML file that everything comes from.
* This is geared specifically for a client project I was working on. There will definitley need to be changes to get this to work in your environment, but I think this at least gets you started with getting your products out of Shopsites format and into something Woocommerce will have a better time with.
