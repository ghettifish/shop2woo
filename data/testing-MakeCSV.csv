<p>Trilobites dominated the waters around the world for millions of years. They were the first free-swimming creatures of any size. The first to have an external skeleton for armor, and the first to have jointed legs. The petrified bodies and casts, or imprints, of Trilobite remains tell us of the creature’s existence. Their three lobes earned them the name Trilobites. Trilobites appeared in the seas about 700 million years ago and were prolific by the time they vanished 350 million’s years later. The deeply furrowed tail shield is smaller than its head. Some specimens may be partially reconstructed. This species is of the Redlichiida order. These fossils are available in 3 sizes: RTF/35 is approximately 7&quot;L x 5&quot;W, RTF/45 is approximately 9&quot;L x 7&quot;W, and RTF/90 is approximately 12&quot;L x 9&quot;W.</p>

<p>These Labradorite ergonomically designed massage wands are sure to be a big hit. Approximately 1&quot;W X 4&quot;L.  Labradorite is truly a fascinating mineral. Its a mineral whose charm is not usually noticed and may be overlooked if not viewed from the proper angle. Generally a dull, dark looking mineral with no special virtue until the colorful shiller is observed glowing on the surface. Labradorite can produce a colorful play of light across cleavage planes. The usually intense colors range from the typical blues and violets through greens, yellows and oranges.

May be brown, red or tan in color.<br><br>Obsidian is a naturally occurring volcanic glass formed as an extrusive igneous rock. It is produced when lava extruded from a volcano cools quickly and without crystal growth. Because of the lack of crystal structure, obsidian blade edges can reach almost molecular thinness, leading to its ancient use as projectile points,i.e., arrowheads and primitive cutting tools,and its modern use as surgical scalpel blades.<br><br>Mahogany Obsidian is a deep reddish-brown with black inclusions.

The smooth stone is referred to as the female, and the rough one is male. They have many powers, mainly balancing peoples auras.<br><br>Approximate sizes and prices are as follows:<br>

Prices run from $2 to $6 each for smaller sizes, $7 to $12 for medium sized pieces, and $13 to $16 for the largest. Labradorite is truly a fascinatingly beautiful mineral. Its a mineral whose charm is not fully noticed and may be overlooked if not viewed from the proper position.

Labradorite can produce a colorful play of light across cleavage planes and in sliced sections called labradorescence. The usually intense colors range from the typical blues and violets through greens, yellows and oranges. Some rare specimens display all these colors simultaneously. The color display is from lamellar intergrowths inside the crystal. These intergrowths result from compatible chemistries at high temperatures becoming incompatible at lower temperatures and thus a separating and layering of these two phases. The resulting color effect is caused by a ray of light entering a layer and being refracted back and forth by deeper layers. This refracted ray is slowed by the extra travel through the layers and mixes with other rays to produce a light ray coming out that has a different wavelength than when it went in. The wavelength could correspond to the wavelength of a particular color, such as blue. The effect depends on the thickness and orientation of the layers.</p>",1,0,"7.00","http://staging-pikespeakrock.kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/store/LABP-1.JPG","",0,"options","LABP/S: $2-$6,LABP/M: $7-$12,LABP/L: $13-$16",1,0

Pyrite from mines at Navajun, LaRioja, Spain are unique in the world both for their perfect cubic symmetry and for the gloss and finish of their surfaces. The old inhabitants of these lands were attracted by these surprising metallic stones that may be found in this part of La Rioja and the neighboring Soria. Proof of this are the archeological findings of the nearby celtiberic city of Contrebia Leucade, in Inestrillas, where pieces inserted in the fine frames of the mosaics have been found. Witches (there are people who talk about the properties of gemotherapy) recommend them to cure throat and stomach aches, and even to attract wealth. Pyrite (whose name comes from the Greek root pyr, fire), also known as fools gold after its misleading yellow gleam, is a sulfide mineral formed under extremely high pressures and temperatures. <br>

<p>Labradorite Chunks are approximately 1.5&quot; - 3.5&quot;. Labradorite is truly a fascinating mineral.  Labradorite can produce a colorful play of light across cleavage planes and in sliced sections called labradorescence. The usually intense colors range from the typical blues and violets through greens, yellows and oranges. Some rare specimens display all these colors simultaneously.  The color display is from lamellar intergrowths inside the crystal. These intergrowths result from compatible chemistries at high temperatures becoming incompatible at lower temperatures and thus a separating and layering of these two phases. The resulting color effect is caused by a ray of light entering a layer and being refracted back and forth by deeper layers. This refracted ray is slowed by the extra travel through the layers and mixes with other rays to produce a light ray coming out that has a different wavelength than when it went in. The wavelength could correspond to the wavelength of a particular color, such as blue. The effect depends on the thickness and orientation of the layers.    Our labradorite is of the highest quality mined in Madagascar.    Labradorite is said to provide clarity, attract success and aid in the use and interpretation of dreams.</p>",1,0,"2.00","http://staging-pikespeakrock.kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/store/LABC-1.jpg","",0,"options","","",0

Amazonite is a gemstone variety of green microcline, a feldspar mineral. It is named after the Amazon river in Brazil. Surprisingly, no deposits of it have been found there. The name may refer to the variable green shades of the rainforest along the big river that are reflected in the gemstone.

<p>Labradorite is truly a fascinating mineral. Its a mineral whose charm is not fully noticed and may be overlooked if not viewed from the proper position. It may be considered a dull, dark looking mineral with no special virtue until the colorful schiller is observed glowing on the surface. Labradorite can produce a colorful play of light across cleavage planes and in sliced sections called labradorescence. The usually intense colors range from the typical blues and violets through greens, yellows and oranges. Some rare specimens display all these colors simultaneously. Our Labradorite is of the highest quality mined in Madagascar. Labradorite is said to provide clarity, attract success and aid in the use and interpretation of dreams.<br />

Amazonite is a gemstone variety of green microcline, a feldspar mineral. It is named after the Amazon river in Brazil. Surprisingly, no deposits of it have been found there. The name may refer to the variable green shades of the rainforest along the big river that are reflected in the gemstone. Amazonite is said to calm one's emotions and soothe nerves, and to enhance creativity and the ability to express oneself. Perhaps the strongest recommendation of its metaphysical powers is that Amazonite is said to make your married life happier.

Lepidolite is an uncommon mica and has only in the past decade become available on the mineral market in large quantities. Lepidolite is an ore of lithium and forms in granitic masses that contain a substantial amount of lithium. The lithium content in lepidolite does vary greatly however and low lithium lepidolite is nearly useless as an ore of lithium. The typical violet to pink color of lepidolite is characteristic and is the only field test available to identify lepidolite from other micas. Pink muscovite or very pale lepidolite may confuse an identification. Lepidolite was discovered in the eigtheenth century and was originally known as lilalite (from the Hindu word 'lila' meaning play, game).
Lepidolite is not technically a gemstone, but a very beautiful purplish type of mica. It is referred to by healers as the Peace Stone. Comes on a wood base, prices range from $4 to $11.

<p>Septarian Dragon Eggs, also known as Septarian nodules, were formed around 50 to 70 million years ago as a result of volcanic eruptions. Dead sea life was chemically attracted to the sediment around it forming mud balls which, when the ocean receded, dried up. Due to their bentonite content they also shrank in size, creating the cracks inside. Septarian comes from the Latin &quot;septem&quot; meaning seven because the mud balls tended to crack in 7 points in every direction, creating the distinct pattern these nodules exhibit.</p>",1,0,"16.00","http://staging-pikespeakrock.kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/store/SDE-new.jpg","",0,"options","SDE/XXS: $5-$15,SDE/XS: $16-$30,SDE/S: $31-$50,SDE/M: $51-$70,SDE/L: $71-$100,SDE/XL: $101-$125,SDE/XXL: $126-$150,SDE/XXXL: $151-$225,SDE/Jumbo: $226 & up",1,0

They are called Alligator Quartz in Brazil because of its resemblance to the bumps on the back of a crocodile or alligator. Elestial crystals are mostly smoky in color, and are recognized by multiple terminations, all facing in the same direction and appearing to have melted into each other. These specimens are unique and are very difficult to find.<br />

Black Rainbow Carbide (also known as Carborundum and Silicon Carbide) is a compound of silicon and carbon. It occurs in nature as the extremely rare mineral moissanite. This mineral in its powder form has been mass-produced since 1893 for use as an abrasive. Electronic applications of silicon carbide such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and detectors in early radios were first demonstrated around 1907! <br>

Faceted High Grade Iron Pyrite. Chispa is the South American name for Iron Pyrite, also known as ""fools gold"". This mineral is an iron sulfide with a metallic luster and pale brass-yellow hue that gives it a superficial resemblance to gold, hence the well-known nickname.<br><br>
Sphalerite is a mineral that is the chief ore of zinc. It consists largely of zinc sulfide in crystalline form but almost always contains variable iron. When iron content is high it is an opaque black variety. It is usually found in association with galena, pyrite, and other sulfides. Miners have also been known to refer to Sphalerite as black-jack and ruby jack.<br><br>

<p>Petrified Wood is a fossil in which the organic remains have been replaced by minerals in the slow process of being replaced with stone. This petrification process generally results in a quartz chalcedony mineralization. Petrified Wood can preserve the original structure of the stem in all its detail, down to the microscopic level. Structures such as tree rings and the various tissues are often observed features.<br />
<br />
This Petrified Wood is from the Rainbow Beds in Navajo County, Arizona. Referred to as &quot;River Run&quot; or &quot;River Tumbled&quot;, these minerals are naturally tumbled over the course of hundreds of years near the Petrified Forest in the vicinity of Holbrook, Arizona.<br />

<b>This Citrine in naturally formed, not irradiated (heated to speed the natural process).</b></p>
<p>We happened upon an ultra rare find: Naturally formed Citrine!! While it is made from quartz (the most common type of mineral), it is quite rare to find in its natural form. Citrine has a beautiful yellow color which can vary from a light or pale yellow to a yellowish orange.</p>
<p>Citrine is the official birthstone for the month of November and is also the Planetary stone for the Sun Sign of Virgo. Citrine is believed to help the heart, kidney, digestive tract, liver, and muscles by the metaphysical community. It promotes creativity, helps personal clarity and eliminates self-destructive tendencies.<br />
Get this beautiful, rare stone while it lasts!! <br />

<p>Apatite is often mistaken for other minerals. This tendency is reflected in the mineral's name, which is derived from the Greek word &alpha;&pi;&alpha;&tau;&epsilon;ί&nu; (apatein), which means to deceive or to be misleading. Apatite is the most common phosphate mineral and is the main source of the phosphorus required by plants. The bones and teeth of most animals, including humans, are composed of calcium phosphate, which is the same material as Apatite. Asparagus Stone is another name used to refer to the yellow-green to green color variety of Apatite.</p>

<p>Amazonite is a gemstone variety of green microcline, a feldspar mineral. It is named after the Amazon river in Brazil. Surprisingly, no deposits of it have been found there. The name may refer to the variable green shades of the rainforest along the big river that are reflected in the gemstone. Amazonite is said to calm one's emotions and soothe nerves, and to enhance creativity and the ability to express oneself. Perhaps the strongest recommendation of its metaphysical powers is that Amazonite is said to make your married life happier. </p>

<p>These Labradorite Slabs vary widely in sizes depending on the piece. Labradorite is truly a fascinating mineral. Labradorite can produce a colorful play of light across cleavage planes and in sliced sections called labradorescence. The usually intense colors range from the typical blues and violets through greens, yellows and oranges. Some rare specimens display all these colors simultaneously. The color display is from lamellar intergrowths inside the crystal. These intergrowths result from compatible chemistries at high temperatures becoming incompatible at lower temperatures and thus a separating and layering of these two phases. The resulting color effect is caused by a ray of light entering a layer and being refracted back and forth by deeper layers. This refracted ray is slowed by the extra travel through the layers and mixes with other rays to produce a light ray coming out that has a different wavelength than when it went in. The wavelength could correspond to the wavelength of a particular color, such as blue. The effect depends on the thickness and orientation of the layers. Our Labradorite is of A-B grade and mined in Madagascar. Labradorite is said to provide clarity, attract success and aid in the use and interpretation of dreams.</p>
